# 3D printed FFB Joystick
## Because I thought this wouldn't be this hard
### And I was really *really* wrong
#### But hey it almost works

## How?

ODrive with two *large* brushless DC motors.
3D printed body and gimbals with common bearings and 8020 extrusion as my chosen mounting method. Rev Robotics encoders with an arduino micro controlling the odrive and showing up as a joystick for Windows.

# Is it safe?
# **No.** It is **NOT** safe.
I am not a mechanical engineer, this thing has nasty pinch points, with the 6:1 torque multiplier I think it'll break fingers without much trouble if you get in the way of the gimbal / lower joystick mount area.

Yes of course I want to make it safer, I am iterating on the design and working towards something I wouldn't be terrified of letting someone else touch.

# It will hurt the whole time you drive to the hospital
I don't think it will kill you (it could if you really screwed up on the power supply / shorting something and causing a fire) but it hasn't passed **any** certifications, if you choose to use anything (designs, stls, motor sizing, etc) from this project you're doing it at your own risk. If you do build it, please be careful!
